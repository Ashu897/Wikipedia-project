3. <head>: Contains metadata about the HTML document, such as the character set and title.
4. <body>: Contains the visible content of the HTML document, including the header, main content, and JavaScript code.

  Header Section:
  
1. <div class="header">: Defines a section at the top of the page for the header content.
2. <a href="https://your-main-website.com" class="home-link" onclick="returnToHome()">Home</a>: Creates a link labeled "Home" that points to a main website. The returnToHome() function is called when this link is clicked, but the function is not defined in the provided code.

  Main Content Section:

  JavaScript:

3.Event listeners: Attach event listeners to the search button, search input field (listening for Enter key press), and font size input field. These listeners trigger specific actions when events occur, such as initiating a search or adjusting font size.

4.toggleColorPicker(): Toggles the display of the color picker for font color selection.

5.changeFontColor(): Changes the font color of search results based on the selected color from the color picker.

Styling:

2.The Teko font from Google Fonts is imported and applied to the entire document.
3.Bootstrap is included to enhance styling consistency and provide additional design elements.

API Integration:
